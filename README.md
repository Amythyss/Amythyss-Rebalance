### Overview
This is a collection of mods originally meant for personal use only, this means that:
- Community feedback (positive or negative) is read but will **not** be considered when updating the mod.
- Suggestions may be given, but requests will not be accepted.

### Balance
The mod is balanced following my standards, any request to balance things differently will be ignored.

### Releases (mod updates)
Given what I stated previously:[^1]
- Updates are not guaranteed (I may update the mod on a daily basis or not at all for months).
- Updates may change things completely.

### Contributions
**You can contribute to my mods** and improve their code (I only like spaghetti in my plate) or fix bugs, however contributions are not guaranteed to be accepted.

-----

### I spotted a bug!
Good catch! Now there are two possible paths:
- Create a branch, update my code and then make a pull request.
- Create a [Bug Report](https://github.com/riddemon/StellarisMods/issues) and try to explain the issue to the best of your capabilities.
Thank you.

### You removed a feature I liked!
I am really sorry for removing a feature you liked, you can create a mod to add it back by:
- Using my old code (You are required to follow the [License](https://github.com/riddemon/StellarisMods?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme)).
- Coding it in yourself.

### Someone cloned your mod and is taking credit for it.
Everyone is allowed to distribute my mods but has to state any changes[^2], therefore has to credit me regardless of changes being made or not.
Please make them aware of this and ask them to make the necessary changes.

### Your haven't updated the mod in months / years!
This may be for an extensive number of reasons. Here's what you can do:
- Write a comment on the mod's page.
  - I may have forgotten about it.
  - I may be working on it.
  - I may have designated someone to continue on my work.
- Fork my mod and create your own[^2].
  - **Depending on the changes you made** you may be requested to delete your mod to avoid conflicts with the original one.
- Wait and hope.
