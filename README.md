# StellarisMods
Repository containing all the data relating my stellaris mods.

### Overview
This is a collection of mods originally meant for personal use only, this means that:
- Community feedback (positive or negative) is read but will not be considered when updating the mod.
- Suggestions may be given, but requests will not be accepted.

### Updates
Given what I stated previously:
- Updates are not guaranteed (I may update the mod on a daily basis or not at all for months).
- Updates may change things completely.

### Balance
The mod is balanced following my standards, any request to balance things differently will be ignored.
