### Overview
This is a collection of mods originally meant for personal use only, this means that:
- Community feedback (positive or negative) is read but will **not** be considered when updating the mod.
- Suggestions may be given, but requests will not be accepted.

### Balance
The mod is balanced following my standards, any request to balance things differently will be ignored.

### Releases (mod updates)
Given what I stated previously:
- Updates are not guaranteed (I may update the mod on a daily basis or not at all for months).
- Updates may change things completely.

### Contributions
**You can contribute to my mods** and improve their code (I only like spaghetti in my plate) or fix bugs, however contributions are not guaranteed to be accepted.

### I spotted a bug!
Good catch! Now there are two possible paths:
- Create a branch, update my code and then make a pull request.
- Create a [Bug Report](https://github.com/riddemon/StellarisMods/issues) and try to explain the issue to the best of your capabilities.
Thank you.

### You removed a feature I liked!
I am really sorry for removing a feature you liked, you can create a mod to add it back by:
- Using my old code to create a mod that reintroduces it, however please follow the [License](https://github.com/riddemon/StellarisMods?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file#readme) and give credit to the original creator (me).
- Code the feature back in, no need to give me credit or follow the license as I can't license ideas.
