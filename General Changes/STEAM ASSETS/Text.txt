[h1] Updates [/h1]
This mod was originally meant for [b]personal use[/b], therefore updates are not guaranteed and the mod may change a lot between versions.

[h1] Balance [/h1]
The mod is balanced [b]following my standards[/b].
I am sorry if it does not follow yours (or someone else's) but there will be no effort to balance further than my own needs and opinions.
