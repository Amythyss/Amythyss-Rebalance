According to the Paradox Development Studios' "User Modding Rules of PDS Games" I cannot license this code (point 4).

> The User Mod may not include ANY kind of license or claim of copyright distributed with the mod (You may have a Credits section).

Therefore, since Github defines a repository with no license as 'covered by Copyright law', the license file of this code is used to define this code as NOT covered by any license or Copyright.

Having discussed Copyright and license, Paradox Development Studios also removes reuploads. Therefore you are required to:
- State any changes (if any) to my code.
- Give me credit for the source (original) code.
